###ARC (Automatic Reference Counting)

#####Weak References
A *weak reference* is a reference that does not keep a strong hold on the instance it refers to, and so does not stop ARC from disposing of the referenced instance. 

#####Unowned References
Like a weak reference, an *unowned reference* does not keep a strong hold on the instance it refers to. Unlike a weak reference, however, an unowned reference is used when the other instance has the same lifetime or a longer lifetime. 

However, there is a third scenario, in which both properties should always have a value, and neither property should ever be nil once initialization is complete. In this scenario, itâ€™s useful to combine an unowned property on one class with an implicitly unwrapped optional property on the other class.

###Resolving Strong Reference Cycles for Closures
It should define a *capture list* as part of the closure's definition.


```swift
	lazy var someClosure: () -> String = {
		[unowned self, weak delegate = self.delegate!] in
		// closure body goes here
	}
```
